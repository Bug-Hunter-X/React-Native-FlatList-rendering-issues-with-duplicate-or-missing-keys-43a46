This error occurs when using the `FlatList` component in React Native and providing an invalid or inconsistent `keyExtractor` function.  The `keyExtractor` function is crucial for FlatList's internal optimization and data management. If it doesn't return a unique key for each item, you may encounter unexpected behavior, including incorrect rendering, duplicated items, or performance issues. 

Example of Incorrect `keyExtractor`:

```javascript
<FlatList
  data={[{id: 1}, {id: 2}, {id: 1}]} 
  renderItem={({item}) => <Text>{item.id}</Text>}
  keyExtractor={(item) => item.id} //This is incorrect as ID 1 is duplicated
/>
```

The above example is wrong because the ID 1 is duplicated. FlatList uses these keys to identify and update items efficiently.  If keys are duplicated, FlatList might fail to track changes correctly, leading to the described issues.
