The solution involves providing a correct `keyExtractor` that returns a unique key for every item in your data array. This key must be unique across the entire dataset and remain consistent for each item's lifecycle.  The key should ideally be a string or a number. 

Here's how to fix the example above:

```javascript
<FlatList
  data={[{id: 1, uniqueKey: '1a'}, {id: 2, uniqueKey: '2b'}, {id: 1, uniqueKey: '1c'}]} 
  renderItem={({item}) => <Text>{item.id}</Text>}
  keyExtractor={(item) => item.uniqueKey} 
/>
```

This corrected code adds a unique `uniqueKey` to each object in the data array and uses this key in the `keyExtractor` function.  This guarantees that each item has a unique identifier.  If your data already has a unique identifier (e.g., an ID from a database), you should use that field as the key.

**Best Practices:**

* Use a field that will always be unique within your data. 
* If you do not have a suitable unique identifier, consider generating one using a library like UUID. 
* Ensure the key remains consistent throughout the item's lifetime in the FlatList. 
* Avoid using the index as a key unless your data is strictly static and the order will never change.
